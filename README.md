# ItalDeathMessages
First custom plugin for minecraft servers 1.8.8 

Be aware that the plugin is still far from being good so there might be several bugs

The plugin simply adds custom italian death messages with severeal of the minecraft deaths like 
- Lava
- Fire
- Drowning
- Projectiles
- Killed by another player (WIP)
To better use the plugin you need to turn default death messages off with the command
/gamerule showDeathMessages false

Enjoy!
